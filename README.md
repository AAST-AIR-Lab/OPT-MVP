# Real-World Optimization with NLP
This repository contains code and examples for solving real-world optimization problems using various NLP techniques. The goal is to demonstrate how natural language processing can be leveraged to address complex optimization challenges in diverse domains.

# Overview
Optimization problems are ubiquitous in the real world, arising in areas such as logistics, scheduling, resource allocation, and decision-making. Traditional optimization approaches often rely on mathematical modeling and algorithmic techniques. However, in many real-world scenarios, the problem definitions, constraints, and objectives may be expressed in natural language, requiring the integration of NLP methods.

## This repository explores the use of NLP for real-world optimization, including:

Problem Formulation: Extracting structured optimization problem definitions from unstructured text using techniques such as named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and text classification.
Constraint Modeling: Encoding natural language constraints into mathematical representations using semantic parsing, knowledge graphs, and logical reasoning.
Objective Specification: Identifying and quantifying optimization objectives from textual descriptions using sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment extraction, and unsupervised topic modeling.
Solution Generation: Generating candidate solutions to the optimization problem using language models, reinforcement learning, and hybrid approaches that combine NLP with traditional optimization algorithms.
Solution Evaluation: Assessing the quality of generated solutions by comparing them to natural language descriptions of desired outcomes using semantic similarity, entailment, and generation evaluation metrics.
